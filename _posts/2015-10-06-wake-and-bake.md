“As the title (which is repeated almost 10 times in the chorus) suggests, "Wake & Bake" is a catchy track that guarantees you'll only have one thing on your mind while listening to it. Buddz told Billboard that he initially had the song in mind for a different artist, and you may not be surprised at who it was.”
